# upay Support Suite (plain HTML + CSS + JS)

Files

- admin.html  admin console (live chat inbox with AI analysis, emails, complaints with photo/voice playback, customers, transactions, FAQ, policies, announcements)
- style.css   all styles (includes print layout for the statement)
- core.js     shared helpers, Bangla/English dictionary, student-account defaults
- ai.js       support assistant (intent, redaction, FAQ match)
- db.js       storage (localStorage + cross-tab sync + atomic inc). Replace makeDb() with a real API
- customer.js wallet app (payments, PIN, limits, student plan, guardian, split, support)
- admin.js    admin console
- app.js      boot only (picks admin or customer)
- ../tests/   browser tests (see Tests below)

Run
Best: serve the folder, then open both pages in two tabs.
    python3 -m http.server 8000
    http://localhost:8000/index.html   (customer)
    http://localhost:8000/admin.html   (admin)
Chrome can also open the files directly (double click). Firefox needs the local server.

Voice recording needs microphone permission (works on localhost or https).

More customers: index.html?u=rahim&n=Rahim  (each ?u= is a separate customer)

Data lives in the browser (localStorage) and syncs between tabs on the same browser.
To go multi-device, replace makeDb() in db.js with calls to a backend (FastAPI + PostgreSQL).
All data is synthetic. Reply texts are samples, replace them with upay-approved wording (KB in app.js).

Language
- More > Language switches the whole customer app between Bangla and English (saved in the browser, page reloads).
- The admin console is always English. Bangla texts stored by the app (complaint categories, system messages) are shown in English there.

Account types (More > Account Type)
- Personal: default.
- Islamic: customer can switch directly.
- Student: needs admin approval. The customer fills the form, a request appears in admin > Student accounts, admin approves or rejects (a note is required to reject), and the customer sees the result in the app.
- Admin > Student accounts > Application rules: edit the guidelines (English and Bangla), accepted email domains (default: edu, ac) and which items are required (edu email, university name, student ID number, ID card photo, selfie with ID).
- NOTE: this is a browser-only demo, so the approval is not enforced by a server. For production, check acct/studentOK on the backend.

Student benefits (demo rules, edit constants in app.js)
- Cash Out fee: base 1.85%, verified student accounts get 20% off the fee (feeOf). Send Money fee: 0.
- History: search by phone/name/transaction ID; each row shows day, date, time, phone, receiver name (from saved accounts) and transaction ID.
- More > Student Plan (verified students only): money buckets (set money aside per category, pay from a bucket) and auto transfer (saved account + date/time; sends automatically when money arrives).

Round 2 features
- Every wallet gets a demo phone number (More > profile). Send Money to another wallet's number credits that user and shows their real name.
- Wrong-number protection: Send Money shows recipient name (or a warning if not found) before sending, then a 2-minute Cancel banner that returns the money if the recipient has not spent it.
- Guardian Link (More): a student adds a guardian's number, guardian approves from the bell, then can send money into a student's bucket and view their last 15 transactions.
- Bill Split (home grid): enter total + friends' numbers; each gets a request (bell) to Pay or decline.
- Auto transfer can repeat monthly; History page has a This-month summary by category.
- Needs 2+ wallets (open the app with different ?u= users) to try guardian / split / send between users.

Round 3 (safety, limits, statement)
- Atomic money: every balance change uses db inc() (reads the latest stored value, checks, writes in one locked step), so two tabs/devices can no longer overwrite each other. It also refuses overdraft and debits on frozen wallets. Admin adjustments and reversals use it too. On a real backend this must be a database transaction.
- PIN: first payment asks you to set a 4-digit PIN; every outgoing payment, bill-split payment, guardian send and auto-transfer creation asks for it. 3 wrong tries lock PIN entry for 60 s. More > Change PIN works. Stored as a salted hash in the wallet (demo grade, verify on the server in production).
- Limits: daily 50,000 and monthly 200,000 are enforced on every outgoing payment (also auto-transfers). Account > Transaction Limit shows usage. Change LIM in customer.js.
- Cancel (wrong number): at most 3 cancellations per 24 h per wallet, and only if the recipient still has the money (checked atomically).
- Bill split: each friend pays floor(total / (friends+1)), the remainder stays with you, so requests never add up to more than the bill. Duplicate numbers are ignored. Paying twice is blocked.
- Guardian: when a guardian opens the student's statement the student gets a notification and can remove the link (Guardian Link > x).
- Statement: each row shows balance after the transaction. History has CSV export (what the filter/search shows, opens correctly in Excel with Bangla) and PDF / Print (browser print dialog > Save as PDF).
- Demo tools (More > Demo tools): open test users in new tabs (rahim, karim, abbu, nusrat), make yourself a verified student, clear your PIN. Remove this row before production.

Known limits (need a backend)
- Auto transfer only fires while the app is open (on open, when money arrives, and every 30 s). A server scheduler is needed for "sends even when the app is closed".
- Student approval, PIN, limits and balances all live in the browser, so a technical user can change them. Enforce all of them on the server.
- Bangla/English still works by matching Bangla text against the dictionary in core.js; a new Bangla string needs an entry there or it stays Bangla in English mode (strings built with L(bn,en) do not need one).

Tests
    python3 -m http.server 8765 --directory upay-support-suite &
    python3 tests/test_upay.py            # all, or name a test: python3 tests/test_upay.py t_pin
Needs Python Playwright + Chromium. Covers: concurrent balance updates, fees (normal and student 20% off), free send + receiver name + wrong-number warning, limits, PIN set/wrong/lock, cancel rules, bill split + guardian notification, CSV export, admin load.
